Introduction:

With the vast amount of content available on Netflix, it can be overwhelming for users to find movies and TV shows that match their preferences. Clustering the content can help in organizing and recommending similar titles to users based on their interests.

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to cluster Netflix movies and TV shows into distinct groups. By doing so, we aim to provide users with more personalized recommendations and improve their overall viewing experience.

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is obtained from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. It contains information about various Netflix movies and TV shows, including their titles, directors, cast, genres, release years, and more.

Features:

Title: The title of the movie or TV show.

Director: The director(s) of the movie or TV show.

Cast: The cast members starring in the movie or TV show.

Genre: The genre(s) of the movie or TV show.

Release Year: The year the movie or TV show was released.

Description: A brief description of the movie or TV show.



Clustering Algorithms:

We employ the following clustering algorithms for grouping Netflix movies and TV shows:

K-Means Clustering: A popular unsupervised learning algorithm used for partitioning data into K clusters.

Hierarchical Clustering: A method of cluster analysis that builds a hierarchy of clusters.

Recommender System:A type of information filtering system that predicts or suggests items that a user might be interested in.


Results:

After clustering the Netflix movies and TV shows, we observe distinct groups based on various features such as genre, cast, and release year. The results provide insights into the content library and can be utilized for recommendation systems.
